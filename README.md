> ### **Milestone 1**
To begin I should mention I already have a home server with docker already installed with multiple containers running.  
The tutorial I followed to install docker on my server is located [Here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)

*Docker runtime environment verification*:

*Python prompt from Python container*:

> ### **Milestone 2**
For _milestone-2_, I was tasked to develop a streamlit app that allows the user to enter a text, select a pretrained model and get the sentiment analysis of the text using HuggingFace transformers library and HuggingFace Spaces.

Streamlite app is located [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/julesy/toxic-tweets)
